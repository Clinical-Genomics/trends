# vogue (**version** = 1.0.0) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Clinical-Genomics/vogue/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Clinical-Genomics/vogue?branch=master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Clinical-Genomics/vogue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Clinical-Genomics/vogue)

Vogue is Clinical Genomics solution for capturing data from various places in the data flow and to trend the data over a longer period of time.

## Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/vogue.git
cd vogue
pip install -e .
```

## Contributing
Vogue is using git flow branching model as described in our [development manual](http://www.clinicalgenomics.se/development/dev/gitflow/).

## Front End
All views in vogue should be self-explanatory. There should be no further documentation needed to be able to interpret the content of the web page.

## Back End
The trending database is a Mongo database consisting of following collections:

- **sample** - holds LIMS specific data on sample level. Anchoring identifier are LIMS sample ids.
- **sample_analysis** - holds data from diferent pipeliens on sample level. Anchoring identifier are lims sample ids.
- **flowcell** - holds LIMS specific data on run level. Anchoring identifier are flowcell ids.
- **application_tag** - holds application tag specific data. Anchoring identifier are application tags.

The load command of each collection is described below.

## Data Flow

## CLI
The CLI has two base commands - load and run. The load command is for loading various data into the trending database, and the run command is for running the web application.

### Load sample
```
Usage: vogue load sample [OPTIONS]

  Read and load lims data for one or all samples. When loading many
  samples, the different options -f, -n, -d are used to delimit the subset
  of samples to load.

Options:
  -s, --sample-lims-id TEXT  Input sample lims id
  -m, --many                 Load all LIMS samples if no other options are
                             selected
  --dry-run                  Load from sample or not. (dry-run)
  -f, --load-from TEXT       load from this sample LIMS id. Use if load all
                             broke. Start where it ended
  -n, --new                  Use this flag if you only want to load samples
                             that do not exist in the database
  -d, --date TEXT            Update only samples delivered after date
  --help                     Show this message and exit.
  ```
  
### Load analysis
```
Usage: vogue load analysis [OPTIONS]

  Read and load analysis results. These are either QC or analysis output
  files.

  The inputs are unique ID with an analysis config file (JSON/YAML) which
  includes analysis results matching the analysis model. Analysis types
  recognize the following keys in the input file: QC:multiqc_picard_dups,
  multiqc_picard_HsMetrics, multiqc_picard_AlignmentSummaryMetrics,
  multiqc_picard_insertSize microsalt:blast_pubmlst, quast_assembly,
  blast_resfinder_resistence, picard_markduplicate, microsalt_samtools_stats

Options:
  -s, --sample-id TEXT            Input sample id.  [required]
  -a, --analysis-config PATH      Input config file. Accepted format: JSON,
                                  YAML  [required]
  -t, --analysis-type [QC|microsalt|all]
                                  Type of analysis results to load.
  -c, --analysis-case TEXT        The case that this sample belongs.
                                  It can be
                                  specified multiple times.  [required]
  -w, --analysis-workflow TEXT    Analysis workflow used.  [required]
  --workflow-version TEXT         Analysis workflow used.  [required]
  --is-case                       Specify this flag if input json is case
                                  level.
  --case-analysis-type [multiqc]  Specify the type for the case analysis. i.e.
                                  if it is multiqc output, then choose multiqc
  --dry                           Load from sample or not. (dry-run)
  --help                          Show this message and exit.                      Show this message and exit.
  ```

                                  certificate.
  --reload / --no-reload          Enable or disable the reloader. By default
                                  the reloader is active if debug is enabled.
  --debugger / --no-debugger      Enable or disable the debugger. By default
                                  the debugger is active if debug is enabled.
